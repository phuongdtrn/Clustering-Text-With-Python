# Text Clustering with NLP and clustering techniques
Perform clustering techniques (K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering) on a food dataset to determine which types of food are more likely to be grouped together.

###  Step 1: Preprocess the data
- Remove punctuations, numbers, stop words
- Word stemming: words are reduced to their root form (plural to single)

### Step 2: Create bag of words: Create a word matrix 

###  Step 3: Apply TF-IDF on bag of words to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.
